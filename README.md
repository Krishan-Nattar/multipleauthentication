# multipleauthentication
Built with Laravel 5.6

Have multiple login/registration systems for users and admins
Able to be logged into both systems at once
Logout function will logout from both accounts at same time.

Admins and users are stored on two separate tables. 

A lot of the code needs to be cleaned up.
There are still a bunch of things commented out.
