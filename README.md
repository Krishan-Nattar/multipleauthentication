# multipleauthentication
Have multiple login/registration systems for users and admins
Able to be logged into both systems at once
Logout function will logout from both accounts at same time.

A lot of the code needs to be cleaned up.
There are still a bunch of things commented out.


Current issues 
-logging into a user account then going to the admin page will show the user as logged in on the top right. 
Vice versa is not an issue.
